## Challenge Description
> Sometimes you're in the wrong place at the wrong time.

## Attached Files
- [misframed.zip](misframed.zip)

## Solution
Extract the misframed.zip folder. By observing the four gifs within the folder, I found that the first gif has *flag{* in one of the frames. Using https://ezgif.com/split to split the frames within each gif, I found the four frames: <br />
- *flag{th* <br />
- *3y-t4k3* <br />
- *_7he+J~* <br />
- *tr4in}* <br />

## Flag
```
flag{th3y-t4k3_7he+J~tr4in}
```
