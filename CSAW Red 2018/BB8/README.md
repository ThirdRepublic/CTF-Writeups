## Challenge Description
> BB8 is one of the few robots that Google can find. Do you know where they hide?

## Background Information
>> The robots exclusion standard, also known as the robots exclusion protocol or simply robots.txt, is a standard used by websites to communicate with web crawlers and other web robots. The standard specifies how to inform the web robot about which areas of the website should not be processed or scanned.
[Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard)

## Solution
Based on the challege description, I looked for the robots.txt file. <br/> 
The file was found at https://red.csaw.io/robots.txt
