Oooh! I do like *puzzles*  
:triangular_flag_on_post: Challenges were quite heavy on algorithmic programming  
:triangular_flag_on_post:  The lack of a flag submission box or validator can make some Flags/Solutions unclear

## Challenge 00
![MISC](https://img.shields.io/badge/Challenge-MISC-black.svg?longCache=true&style=for-the-badge)  
No Attempts were made for this [Competitive Programming Challenge](https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/News-Highlights/Article/Article/1624717/march-2018-puzzle-periodical-a-b-c-variable-alphabet-equation/)  
Initial thoughts were to use a SAT solver such as [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)  

```
Find a, b, c, d, e, f, and g, all positive integers greater than 1, that satisfy all equations:


a2 × b × c2 × g = 5100

a × b2 × e × f2 = 33462

a × c2 × d3 = 17150

a3 × b3 × c × d × e2 = 914760

... in the fastest way possible, using your language of choice.
```

## Challenge 05

```
Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less
than n which divide evenly into n).

If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a ≠ b, then a and b are an amicable
pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; 
   therefore d(220) = 284. 

The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; 
   therefore d(284) = 220.



-> Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 100000.

By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent 
numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

3
